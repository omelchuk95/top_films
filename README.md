# Programming assignment

## Run app
`docker-compose up --build`

## Test curl
`curl -X 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8111/films/top/?year=2000&by=genres&row_count=2' -H 'accept: application/json'`

### Disclaimer
I didn't have enough time to finish the project qualitatively. This affected the implementation of ORM and some other things. But the application can be run and checked. I hope you will be able to understand my ideas about architecture, even with an unfinished project
